# Testing/QA Agent - JW Attendant Scheduler

## Agent Responsibilities
Test automation, quality assurance, performance testing, and security validation.

## Current Focus Areas

### 1. Core Test Suite Development
**Priority:** High
**Location:** `tests/` directory
**Requirements:**
- Unit tests for models, views, and services
- Integration tests for critical workflows
- Event-centric architecture testing
- Role-based access control validation

### 2. Automated Testing Pipeline
**Priority:** High
**Location:** CI/CD integration
**Requirements:**
- Automated test execution on pull requests
- Test coverage reporting and enforcement
- Performance regression testing
- Security vulnerability scanning

### 3. User Acceptance Testing
**Priority:** Medium
**Location:** Staging environment
**Requirements:**
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile device testing
- Accessibility compliance testing

## Current Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation Testing
- [ ] Create unit test structure for models
- [ ] Write tests for event-centric architecture
- [ ] Test role-based access control
- [ ] Create integration tests for assignment workflow
- [ ] Set up test database fixtures
- [ ] Implement test coverage reporting

### Phase 2: Automation Pipeline
- [ ] Configure pytest and testing framework
- [ ] Set up CI/CD test automation
- [ ] Create performance benchmarking tests
- [ ] Implement security testing automation
- [ ] Add test result reporting
- [ ] Create test data management system

### Phase 3: Advanced Testing
- [ ] End-to-end testing with Selenium
- [ ] Load testing for production readiness
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] Accessibility compliance testing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Mobile device testing automation

## Technical Specifications

### Test Structure
```python
# tests/test_models.py
class TestEventModel(TestCase):
    def test_event_creation(self):
        # Test event-centric architecture
        pass
    
    def test_attendant_assignment(self):
        # Test assignment workflow
        pass

# tests/test_views.py
class TestRoleBasedAccess(TestCase):
    def test_attendant_dashboard_access(self):
        # Test role-based permissions
        pass
```

### Performance Testing
```python
# tests/performance/test_load.py
class LoadTestCase(TestCase):
    def test_assignment_creation_performance(self):
        # Test auto-assign algorithm performance
        pass
```

## Integration Points
- **Backend Agent**: Model and service testing
- **Frontend Agent**: UI/UX testing automation
- **DevOps Agent**: CI/CD pipeline integration
- **Documentation Agent**: Test documentation and reports

## Success Metrics
- Test coverage > 90%
- All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- Performance tests within acceptable limits
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- 100% accessibility compliance
