- **Environment Configuration**: Production-ready database settings
- **Data Integrity Testing**: Migration includes verification steps

### Production Configuration ‚úÖ
- **Environment Variables**: All secrets externalized to .env files
- **Static File Serving**: WhiteNoise configured for production
- **Gmail Integration**: Email notifications and user invitations ready
- **Security Hardening**: CSRF protection, role-based access, data isolation

## üì± Next Steps for Production

### Immediate Actions
1. **Execute PostgreSQL Migration**:
   ```bash
   # On PostgreSQL container (10.92.3.21)
   ./deployment/setup-postgresql.sh
   
   # On application container (10.92.3.22)
   ./deployment/migrate-to-postgresql.sh
   ```

2. **Configure Reverse Proxy**:
   - Set up NPM proxy for `attendant.cloudigan.net ‚Üí 10.92.3.22:8000`
   - Configure SSL/TLS certificates
   - Set up domain routing

3. **Mobile-Responsive UI Enhancement**:
   - Optimize templates for mobile devices
   - Implement touch-friendly interactions
   - Add progressive web app features

4. **Production Monitoring**:
   - Set up logging and error tracking
   - Configure performance monitoring
   - Implement backup strategies
