## 🔄 Workflow

### When Creating a New Release:

1. **Write User-Facing Release Notes**
   - Location: `/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md`
   - Use template: `/release-notes/TEMPLATE.md`
   - Focus: User benefits and impact
   - Language: Plain, non-technical

2. **Write Technical Deployment Docs** (if needed)
   - Location: `/docs/deployment/vX.Y.Z-technical-details.md`
   - Include: All technical details
   - Audience: Development team
   - Language: Technical, detailed

3. **Commit Both**
   - Public release notes go to `/release-notes/`
   - Technical docs stay in `/docs/deployment/`
   - Users only see release notes
   - Team has full technical context

## 🏢 Enterprise Best Practice

This separation follows enterprise SaaS best practices:

- **Slack:** Public changelog vs internal deployment docs
- **GitHub:** Release notes vs deployment procedures
- **Notion:** User updates vs technical implementation
- **Atlassian:** Customer-facing vs internal operations

**Key Principle:** Users care about WHAT changed, not HOW it was implemented.

- Internal IP addresses
- Infrastructure topology
- Deployment procedures
- System configurations

**Do NOT:**
- Share publicly
- Include in public documentation
- Reference in user-facing materials
- Commit sensitive credentials (use environment variables)
