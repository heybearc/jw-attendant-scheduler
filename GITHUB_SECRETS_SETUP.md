## Security Notes

- These secrets are encrypted and only accessible during workflow runs
- Never commit sensitive values to your repository
- Use environment-specific values for staging vs production
- Rotate passwords regularly for security

## Verification

After adding secrets, push a commit to the `staging` branch to trigger the workflow and verify:
1. Secrets are properly loaded
2. MCP servers can authenticate
3. Deployment process executes successfully

## Next Steps

Once secrets are configured:
1. Set up container directory structure
2. Configure JW Attendant Scheduler on container 134
3. Test full deployment pipeline
