# Feature: Count Times Implementation for Event Positions

## Problem / Outcome
- Users need to track attendee counts at specific times during events for security and management purposes
- Oversight needs to enter counts by position at configured count times
- Success = Event managers can configure count times, oversight can enter counts, and reports show accurate attendance data

## Scope
- In: 
  - Count times configuration per event
  - Count session creation for each time period
  - Count entry interface for oversight users
  - Count reporting and visualization
  - Multi-day event support with multiple count sessions
- Out: 
  - Real-time attendance tracking
  - Automated notifications for count discrepancies
  - Mobile app integration (future enhancement)

## User stories
- As an event administrator, I want to configure count times for an event so that oversight knows when to take counts
- As an oversight user, I want to enter counts by position so that attendance is accurately tracked
- As an event manager, I want to view count reports so that I can monitor attendance patterns
- As an administrator, I want counts to be tracked per event so that historical data is maintained

## Examples (Specification by Example)
- Example A (happy path):
  - Given an event with 53 positions and 2 configured count times (10:00 AM, 2:00 PM)
  - When an oversight user enters counts for all positions at 10:00 AM
  - Then the system records the counts and displays them in the event dashboard
- Example B (multi-day event):
  - Given a 3-day event with count times at 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM each day
  - When an oversight user selects day 2 and enters counts
  - Then the system associates the counts with the correct day and time period
- Example C (edge case):
  - Given an event with positions that have zero attendees
  - When an oversight user enters a count of zero
  - Then the system correctly records zero rather than treating it as missing data

## Non-functional
- Performance: Count entry form must load in under 2 seconds even with 53 positions
- Security: Only oversight and admin users can enter and modify count data
- Observability: Count history must be auditable with timestamps and user information
- Usability: Count entry interface must be optimized for quick data entry during busy events

## Technical Implementation

### Database Models
- `CountTime`: Configuration for when counts should be taken
  - Fields: event (FK), time, name, description
- `CountSession`: Instance of a count being taken
  - Fields: count_time (FK), date, status (pending, in_progress, completed)
- `PositionCount`: Individual position count entry
  - Fields: count_session (FK), position (FK), count_value, notes

### UI Components
- Count times configuration tab in event detail page
- Count entry form optimized for quick data entry
- Count visualization in event dashboard
- Count history and reporting interface

### API Endpoints
- GET/POST `/api/events/{id}/count-times/` - Manage count time configurations
- GET/POST `/api/events/{id}/count-sessions/` - Manage count sessions
- GET/POST `/api/count-sessions/{id}/position-counts/` - Enter and retrieve position counts

## Open questions
- Should we implement count variance alerts when counts differ significantly between time periods?
- Do we need to support partial count submissions (some positions counted, others pending)?
