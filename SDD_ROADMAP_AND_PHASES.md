   - Test library CLI interfaces in production-like environment
   - Validate observability and monitoring integration
   - Performance testing of library operations

3. **Production Migration**
   - Gradual rollout of library-first views
   - Monitor library performance and reliability
   - Validate fallback mechanisms work correctly
   - User acceptance testing with real data

4. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Set up library performance dashboards
   - Configure alerts for library health
   - Implement usage analytics tracking
   - Monitor contract validation metrics

#### Success Criteria:
