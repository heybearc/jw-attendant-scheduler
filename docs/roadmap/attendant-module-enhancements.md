# Attendant Module Enhancement Roadmap

## Current Status
The attendant management module is **functionally complete** and production-ready with comprehensive CRUD operations, CSV import/export, multi-select serving roles, automatic availability rules, and event-specific management workflows.

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### 1. Bulk Operations
**Priority: Medium**
**Estimated Effort: 2-3 weeks**

#### Features:
- **Bulk Delete**: Select multiple attendants and delete them simultaneously
- **Bulk Status Updates**: Change availability status for multiple attendants at once
- **Bulk Role Assignment**: Add or remove serving roles across multiple attendants
- **Bulk Export**: Export selected attendants to CSV with custom field selection

#### Technical Requirements:
- Checkbox selection UI for attendant lists
- Bulk action toolbar with operation buttons
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Progress indicators for long-running bulk operations
- API endpoints supporting batch operations
- Database transaction handling for data integrity

#### User Stories:
- As an administrator, I want to mark multiple attendants as unavailable for a specific period
- As an event coordinator, I want to delete multiple test attendants at once
- As a scheduler, I want to assign "Regular Pioneer" role to multiple attendants simultaneously

### 2. Advanced Filtering and Search
**Priority: High**
**Estimated Effort: 3-4 weeks**

#### Features:
- **Role-based Filtering**: Filter attendants by serving roles (Elder, MS, Pioneer, etc.)
- **Availability Filtering**: Show only available, unavailable, or limited availability attendants
- **Text Search**: Search by name, email, phone, or notes
- **Combined Filters**: Apply multiple filters simultaneously
- **Saved Filter Presets**: Save commonly used filter combinations
- **Quick Filter Buttons**: One-click filters for common scenarios

#### Technical Requirements:
- Advanced search UI with filter dropdowns and text inputs
- URL parameter handling for shareable filtered views
- Database query optimization for complex filters
- Debounced search input for performance
- Filter state persistence in localStorage
- Export functionality that respects active filters

#### User Stories:
- As a scheduler, I want to quickly find all available Elders for an assignment
- As an administrator, I want to see all attendants serving in "Other Department"
- As an event coordinator, I want to search for attendants by phone number

### 3. Event Position Assignment Workflow
**Priority: High**
**Estimated Effort: 4-6 weeks**

#### Features:
- **Position Management**: Define event-specific positions (Security, Parking, Stage, etc.)
- **Assignment Interface**: Drag-and-drop or click-to-assign attendants to positions
- **Schedule Management**: Assign attendants to specific time slots within events
- **Conflict Detection**: Prevent double-booking and highlight scheduling conflicts
- **Assignment History**: Track who was assigned to what positions across events
- **Assignment Templates**: Save and reuse common assignment patterns

#### Technical Requirements:
- New database tables for positions and assignments
- Real-time assignment interface with drag-and-drop functionality
- Conflict detection algorithms
- Assignment notification system
- Reporting and analytics for assignment patterns
- Integration with existing attendant availability rules

#### User Stories:
- As an event coordinator, I want to assign specific attendants to parking positions
- As a scheduler, I want to see who is assigned to each position for an event
- As an attendant, I want to see what positions I'm assigned to across multiple events

### 4. Audit Logging and Change Tracking
**Priority: Medium**
**Estimated Effort: 2-3 weeks**

#### Features:
- **Change History**: Track all modifications to attendant records
- **User Attribution**: Record who made each change and when
- **Field-level Tracking**: Show exactly what fields were modified
- **Audit Trail Export**: Generate reports of changes over time periods
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert changes to previous states
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate audit reports for organizational requirements

#### Technical Requirements:
- Audit log database table with JSON change tracking
- Middleware to capture all CRUD operations
- User session tracking for change attribution
- Audit log viewer interface with filtering and search
- Data retention policies for audit logs
- Performance optimization for high-volume logging

#### User Stories:
- As an administrator, I want to see who changed an attendant's availability status
- As a supervisor, I want to generate a report of all changes made last month
- As a compliance officer, I want to track all data modifications for audit purposes

#### Photo Management
- Upload and display attendant photos
- Photo-based attendant selection interface
- Integration with user profile photos

#### Skills and Certifications
- Track attendant skills and certifications
- Skill-based assignment recommendations
- Certification expiration tracking and alerts

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1** (Next 3 months): Advanced Filtering and Search
2. **Phase 2** (Months 4-6): Event Position Assignment Workflow  
3. **Phase 3** (Months 7-9): Bulk Operations
4. **Phase 4** (Months 10-12): Audit Logging and Additional Features

## Success Metrics

- **User Adoption**: 90%+ of events using position assignment feature
- **Time Savings**: 50% reduction in manual assignment coordination time
- **Data Accuracy**: 99%+ accuracy in attendant availability tracking
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.5+ rating on feature usability surveys

## Technical Considerations

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing attendant data
- Ensure performance scalability for large attendant databases (1000+ attendants)
- Implement proper caching strategies for filtered views
- Consider database indexing for search performance
- Plan for data migration strategies when adding new features
