# Branch Cleanup Recommendations

## SDD-Compliant Feature Branch Structure ✅

### **NEW FEATURE BRANCHES** (Keep - Active Development)
These branches follow proper SDD workflow and contain module-specific specifications:

1. **`feature/event-management-module`** ✅
   - **Status:** Active - Contains complete SDD specification
   - **Purpose:** Event lifecycle management with library-first architecture
   - **Spec Location:** `/specs/event-management/module-spec.md`
   - **Action:** KEEP - Primary module for event operations

2. **`feature/event-centric-attendant-management`** ✅
   - **Status:** Active - Contains production implementation
   - **Purpose:** Attendant management within event context only
   - **Spec Location:** `/specs/event-centric-attendant-management/module-spec.md`
   - **Action:** KEEP - Recently completed with CSV import functionality

3. **`feature/administration-module`** ✅
   - **Status:** Active - Contains complete SDD specification
   - **Purpose:** User management, email config, system administration
   - **Spec Location:** `/specs/administration/module-spec.md`
   - **Action:** KEEP - High complexity module with security requirements

4. **`feature/dashboard-module`** ✅
   - **Status:** Active - Contains complete SDD specification
   - **Purpose:** Role-based personal dashboards with real-time updates
   - **Spec Location:** `/specs/dashboard/module-spec.md`
   - **Action:** KEEP - Core user experience module

5. **`feature/reporting-module`** ✅
   - **Status:** Active - Contains complete SDD specification
   - **Purpose:** Analytics, reporting, and export functionality
   - **Spec Location:** `/specs/reporting/module-spec.md`
   - **Action:** KEEP - Analytics and business intelligence module

## **BRANCHES TO DELETE** ❌

### Legacy/Outdated Branches
These branches do not follow proper SDD workflow or are superseded:

1. **`feature/count-times-implementation`** ❌
   - **Reason:** Legacy implementation without SDD compliance
   - **Superseded By:** `feature/reporting-module` (contains count tracking library)
   - **Action:** DELETE - Functionality moved to reporting module

2. **`feature/sdd-library-first-refactor`** ❌
   - **Reason:** General refactor branch, not module-specific
   - **Status:** Likely completed and merged into main
   - **Action:** DELETE - Refactor work should be in main branch

3. **`feature/staging-testing-and-ui-fixes`** ❌
   - **Reason:** General testing/fixes branch, not module-specific
   - **Status:** Should be completed and merged
   - **Action:** DELETE - Testing work should be integrated into feature branches

4. **`sdd-adopt`** ❌
   - **Reason:** General adoption branch, not following feature branch naming
   - **Status:** SDD adoption should be complete in main
   - **Action:** DELETE - SDD principles now integrated across all modules

## **BRANCHES TO EVALUATE** ⚠️

### Potentially Outdated
These branches may contain work that should be integrated or deleted:

1. **`feature/nextjs-sdd-refactor`** ⚠️
   - **Status:** May contain NextJS implementation work
   - **Evaluation Needed:** Check if work is integrated into main or feature branches
   - **Action:** EVALUATE - Delete if work is integrated, keep if active development

2. **`develop`** ⚠️
   - **Status:** Traditional development branch
   - **Evaluation Needed:** Determine if still used for integration
   - **Action:** EVALUATE - May be redundant with proper feature branch workflow

---

## **CORE BRANCHES** (Keep - Required)

### Essential Repository Branches
1. **`main`** ✅ - Production-ready code
2. **`dev`** ✅ - Development integration branch (base for feature branches)

---

## **LESSONS LEARNED TO INCORPORATE INTO MAIN**

### SDD Implementation Lessons
1. **Event-Centric Architecture Success**
   - Strict event-context-only attendant management prevents architectural drift
   - Modal-based forms maintain clean separation of concerns
   - CSV import functionality enhances user productivity

2. **Library-First Development Benefits**
   - CLI interfaces enable automation and testing
   - Contract validation prevents integration issues
   - Observability framework provides operational insights

3. **Feature Branch Workflow Improvements**
   - Each module requires dedicated SDD specification
   - Module-specific branches enable parallel development
   - Clear integration points prevent coupling issues

### Technical Implementation Lessons
1. **Database Schema Management**
   - Prisma client caching issues require careful regeneration
   - Schema changes need coordinated deployment
   - Field removal/addition requires migration planning

2. **Frontend Development Patterns**
   - Real-time status updates improve user experience
   - Role-based UI filtering enhances security
   - Bulk operations (CSV import) are essential for productivity

3. **Deployment and Infrastructure**
   - Staging-first development prevents production issues
   - SSH-based deployment enables rapid iteration
   - Environment synchronization critical for team development

## **RECOMMENDED ACTIONS**

### Immediate Actions
1. **Delete Legacy Branches:**
   ```bash
   git branch -D feature/count-times-implementation
   git branch -D feature/sdd-library-first-refactor
   git branch -D feature/staging-testing-and-ui-fixes
   git branch -D sdd-adopt
   ```

2. **Evaluate and Clean:**
   ```bash
   # Check if nextjs work is integrated
   git log feature/nextjs-sdd-refactor --oneline
   # Evaluate develop branch usage
   git log develop --oneline
   ```

3. **Update Main Branch:**
   - Merge lessons learned documentation
   - Update SDD compliance guidelines
   - Document feature branch workflow

### Long-term Workflow
1. **Feature Branch Standards:**
   - All new work starts from `dev` branch
   - Feature branches named: `feature/[module-name]-module`
   - Each feature branch contains module-specific SDD spec
   - No direct commits to `main` - only merges from feature branches

2. **Module Development Process:**
   - Create feature branch from `dev`
   - Implement SDD specification first
   - Develop library-first implementation
   - Test CLI interfaces and contracts
   - Merge to `dev` for integration testing
   - Merge to `main` for production deployment

This cleanup establishes a proper SDD-compliant feature branch workflow where each module has its own development branch with complete specifications, enabling context-free development by any Windsurf agent.
