./deployment/migrate-to-postgresql.sh
```

#### Application Restart
```bash
# Update environment for PostgreSQL
systemctl restart jw-attendant
```

### 📋 Next Priority Tasks

#### High Priority (Production Critical)
1. **Execute PostgreSQL Migration**: Run migration scripts on containers
2. **Event-Scoped Assignment System**: Complete assignment management integration
3. **NPM Proxy Configuration**: Set up attendant.cloudigan.net → 10.92.3.22:8000
4. **Mobile-Responsive UI**: Ensure all interfaces work on mobile devices

#### Medium Priority (Feature Enhancement)
1. **Event-Scoped Reports**: Implement event-specific reporting system
2. **Event-Scoped Oversight**: Complete oversight management integration
3. **Event-Scoped Lanyards**: Implement lanyard tracking per event
4. **Production Monitoring**: Add logging, error handling, and monitoring

### 🏗️ Architecture Overview

#### Event-Centric Flow
```
Login → Event Selection → Dashboard → Event Management
                ↓
    Attendants | Assignments | Reports | Oversight | Lanyards
```

#### Container Architecture
```
Internet → NPM (Proxy) → jw-attendant (10.92.3.22:8000)
                              ↓
                         postgres-01 (10.92.3.21:5432)
```
